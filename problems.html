                <hr class="line-top">
                <div class="main-top-text">
                    <p>It’s been established that accessibility is good for business, but what does 
                        the law say? </p>
                    <br>   
                    <p>The Disability and Discrimination Act 2005 states that it’s unlawful to make 
                        it unreasonably difficult for a disabled person to use a service. The Equality 
                        Act 2010 adds that disabled people should have equal access to education, 
                        employment, goods, services, facilities and transport. Service providers had 
                        to make changes (known as ‘reasonable adjustments’) to ensure their facilities 
                        were suitable once the act became law.</p> 
                    <br>   
                    <p>Thermae Spa in Bath is one example. It’s on a site with several listed buildings, 
                        so they installed lifts wherever possible and ramps where renovations are 
                        restricted. The beds in their treatment rooms can be raised or lowered 
                        accordingly, there are hoists, assisted seating, and shallow step access 
                        into the pools, and their signs are tactile and written in Braille. Private 
                        changing rooms for wheelchair users are available. Local accessibility group, 
                        Access Bath, gave feedback throughout the process to ensure facilities 
                        were suitable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="main-top-text2">
                    <p>
                        Despite these measures, accessibility problems are still an issue 
                        throughout the country. Facilities such as toilets and changing rooms 
                        in high street shopping complexes aren’t always adequate, while unsuitable 
                        parking facilities, public transport, and routes in town centres restrict 
                        ease of movement. In some cases, they may deter disabled people from 
                        visiting a place at all.

                            Ideally, street furniture takes all users into account, rather than 
                            compromising the needs of one group for those of another. For example, 
                            placing benches at regular intervals gives people a place to rest, but 
                            it’ll restrict mobility for wheelchair users if they can’t get through.
