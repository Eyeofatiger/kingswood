                <h3>What is town planning?</h3>
                <hr class="lineTop">
                <div class="article1">
                    <p>A lot of town planning goes on without us noticing. We only really spot it when
                        things go wrong – when construction work overruns or accessibility is difficult.
                        But it’s the role of town planning to ensure any development of urban areas is
                        successful and inclusive for all. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The definition in the Oxford Dictionary states:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="articleP">“Town planning is the planning and control of construction, growth, and
                        development
                        of a town or other urban area.”</p>
                </div>
                <div class="article2">
                    <p>The idea of improving the towns we live in has been around for some time.
                        In the late 1800s, unplanned suburbs began to appear in large cities,
                        which prompted much discussion about how growth could be controlled,
                        and how environments could be improved for the people who lived and spent
                        time in them. The concept of garden cities was created. They mixed features
                        of towns and the countryside – rows of houses were spaced further apart and
                        greenery like trees and gardens were introduced. The Housing and Town Planning
                        Act (1909) also made it illegal for housing to sit back-to-back.</p>

                <div class="article3">
                    <p>Over time, a lot has been learnt about how we can improve the places in which we
                        live. Town planning officers are responsible for a lot of sectors. These include
                        housing, heritage and conservation, waste, transport, and health, as well as
                        construction, which is where street furniture fits in. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Many other groups are involved, including:</p>

                <div class="groups1">
                    <p>Planning inspectors </p>

                    <p>They work together to make sure new projects are safe, accessible, and meets the
                        needs of everyone who’ll use them. Communities must have access to the facilities
                        they need, such as homes, offices, shops, hospitals, and schools, and the right
                        infrastructure (like roads, railways, and other public spaces) must be in place
                        to support them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Different environmental sites will have a range of physical features and
                        requirements which all have to be taken into account. There may also be conflict
                        between the needs of different businesses or private landowners. It’s a
                        balancing act.</p>

                <h1 class="mainTopH">The importance of accessible public infrastructures</h1>
                <hr class="topMainLine">
                <div class="mainArticle1">
                    <p>Members of the public should be able to go about their lives without encountering
                        any issues. The logical layout of a space helps to instil feelings of familiarity
                        and confidence amongst users. If you can identify where you are, behave in a
                        certain way, and follow particular patterns, you will be relatively safe, feel
                        onfident, and be able to complete your journey. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, poorly thought-out design can cause accessibility problems and stop
                        people from carrying out everyday errands. Your options become very limited if
                        you can’t enter a building, use a public bathroom, or park your car in a
                        suitable space.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Disabled people can be particularly disadvantaged by inaccessible infrastructure,
                        but it also affects their carers, the elderly, and parents with young children.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the past, solutions to accessibility problems would often have to be added
                        to existing structures and could be separate from the way other users navigate
                        a space. However, in recent years, the approach has become more inclusive and
                        it’s recommended that accessible solutions are included in plans from
                        the beginning.</p>

                <div class="main-article2">
                    <p>Parts of the UK and Europe have developed the concept of sharing, which aims to
                        create more pedestrian-friendly public spaces that offer greater safety for users,
                        encouraging motorists and cyclists to be slower and more careful. In order for the
                        concept of sharing to work, the needs of disabled people, children and the elderly
                        must be taken into account. The way a person uses a space will depend on their
                        abilities and interpretations – these will differ depending on their individual
                        circumstances. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>That’s not to say improving the accessibility of existing spaces is no longer
                        necessary. In 2017, Chester was awarded first prize in the European Access City
                        Award for going beyond the legal requirements for accessibility, particularly for
                        their historic city walls. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The award is a chance for cities to:</p>

                <div class="main-article4">
                    <p>Ramps, level access, tactile paving and additional handrails have all been
                        added to Chester’s walls over the years, and access points are shown on
                        panels around the city. They also provide accessible units where disabled
                        people can wash and change. This allows people with specialist needs to spend
                        more time enjoying the city.</p>

                        <p>Planning permission is more likely to be accepted if accessible street
                            furniture (and other inclusive aspects of the design) are considered at
                            every stage of development, especially if the building or site is historic
                            and subject to conservation laws.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It’s often too late to overcome accessibility barriers if you don’t take
                            them into consideration until the planning application stage. The
                            government’s planning permission resources highlight the importance of

                        <p>Design influences the way we use a space, which means it has an impact on
                            our wellbeing. Good design, therefore, isn’t just about the quality of
                            buildings and spaces – it’s about making sure they address the needs of e
                            veryone in society in a thoughtful and efficient way.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It’s more cost-effective to take accessibility into consideration from the
                            start, since you won’t have to make adjustments in future. That said, you
                            can add additional street furniture as demand grows, or if you recognise
                            the needs of the community are changing.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It’s also better for business. More inclusion leads to more footfall and
                            more customers, which means more money will be spent. The impact on the
                            economy is undeniably positive.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In 1999, the Institute for Employment Studies estimated that the spending
                            power of the disabled was £51.3 billion a year. Fifteen years later, the
                            Department for Work and Pensions estimated that the spending power of
                            families with at least one disabled person was over £200 billion a year.</p>
