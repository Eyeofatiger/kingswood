                    Planners and designers are moving away from a ‘one-size-fits-all’ 
                    mindset. A piece of street furniture won’t just have a single purpose 
                    anymore, because there are ways of making it even more useful as 
                    technology improves – such as incorporating digital devices into 
                    the design. You’d let the programme know what you want guidance on, 
                    then share your smartphone’s ID so the street furniture can respond 
                    accordingly when you’re nearby.

                         A street light may change its brightness according to the 
                         needs of the person walking by.

                        A bollard or bin might give audio information to someone who’s

                        Larger structures could have fold-down seats for those who 
                        aren’t in wheelchairs but whose mobility is limited.

                        Traffic lights can allow pedestrians more time to cross the

                        Planners have often had to pick one disability over the other in the 
                        past, meaning a problem solved for one group is a problem caused for 
                        another. Extra seating may be useful for some, but it reduces the amount 
                        of space someone in a wheelchair has to move in, and in some cases may 
                        even block their way completely.

                        Likewise, simple designs and calm colours are more soothing for those 
                        with autism, but the blind and visually impaired need bright, c
                        ontrasting colours and distinctive, tactile features to help them 
                        understand where they are.
